# qss-maker
a graphical user interface for designing pyqt5 aplications

This code will create a sqlite3 database to save properties in it and then using this database, it creates corresponding qss file.

I am new to pyqt5 (and even github) and I do not know about how many properties do any widget have; so everyone is welcome to edit the code to make it better.

Purpose of this app is to be used for embedding in your own projects, so that your clients can design their own style for your app or manipulate the current design of yours based on their preferences.
